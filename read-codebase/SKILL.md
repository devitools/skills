# Semantic Code Exploration

This skill guides efficient code exploration using **Serena MCP** for semantic navigation.

## Prerequisite Check

Before proceeding, verify Serena is available by checking for `mcp__serena__*` tools.

**If Serena is NOT configured:**
Tell the user: "This exploration would benefit from Serena MCP for semantic code navigation, but it's not configured. See `.claude/skills/read-codebase/setup.md` for installation instructions. Proceeding with standard tools (Grep/Read/Glob)."

Then use standard tools as fallback.

## Tool Priority (when Serena is available)

1. **get_symbols_overview** - First step for any file
2. **find_symbol** - Locate specific classes/methods
3. **find_referencing_symbols** - Find all usages
4. **search_for_pattern** - When symbol name is unknown
5. **read_memory** - Check project knowledge (architecture, patterns)

## Quick Reference

### Understanding a File
1. `get_symbols_overview(relative_path="path/to/file.php")` → see structure
2. `find_symbol(name_path_pattern="ClassName", depth=1)` → see methods
3. Only use `include_body=true` for specific methods you need

### Finding Where Code Is Used
1. `find_symbol` to locate the symbol
2. `find_referencing_symbols` to find all call sites

### Exploring Unknown Code
1. Check memories: `list_memories` → `read_memory("architecture")`
2. Use `search_for_pattern` with keywords
3. Follow up with symbolic tools

## Anti-Patterns

- Reading entire files when you only need one method
- Using Grep/Read when Serena tools would be more precise
- Skipping symbol overview and going straight to file read
- Not checking project memories for existing documentation

## When to Use Standard Tools Instead

- Simple text search across many files → Grep
- Config files, markdown, non-code → Read
- Known file needing full content → Read
- Serena not configured → Fallback to Grep/Read/Glob
